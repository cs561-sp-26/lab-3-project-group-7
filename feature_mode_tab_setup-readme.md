# CS 561 Lab 3: Branch `<<feature/mode_tab_setup>>`

## Branch Author
Daniel Kish (Danielhk832)

## Summary of Work Done in this Branch

created the modeTabs.js file and modeActions.js file. added the switchMode function to the modeActions.js file, which is responsible for switching between the different modes (scorecard, map, and stats) when a tab is clicked. I also added a click handler for the floating action button to toggle the visibility of the mode tabs. Finally, I added a keydown event handler to allow users to navigate between the mode tabs using the keyboard.
